IMC LiveCloud Server Pinger

Returns "Pong!".

Usage: `pong`

-----

`pong` is primarily used to see if the shell is responding, especially when
using remote connections. `pong` has been included with `ping` for good measure,
and for when you're bored â”€ but be careful not to get stuck in an infinite loop
when replying to the shell!
